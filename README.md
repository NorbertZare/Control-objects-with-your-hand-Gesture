Control objects with your hand Gesture

Controlling digital devices with hand gestures is so cool and you can control things like media, APPs, etc. but controlling physical objects with hand gestures is much cooler.
In this project with the help of computer vision I'm controlling a printed photo with hand gestures.

This project has two parts:
first part is a python code that runs on the computer.
and second part is hardware, including Arduino board and 3 servo motors.

in python code with the help of opencv and mediapipe we can trace finger motions and based on finger motions we send commands to Arduino board with serial port and Arduino controls servo motors.

For running the python code you need PyCharm software
before running the code you should install:
opencv
mediapipe
Serial
